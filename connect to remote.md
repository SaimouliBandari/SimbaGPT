**1. Install Streamlit and Lammps**

Make sure you have Streamlit installed on your cloud-based machine. You 
can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install streamlit
```
For LAMMPS, you'll need to download the source code from a repository 
(e.g., GitHub or SourceForge) and compile it on the remote host.

**2. Set up SSH tunneling**

Create an SSH tunnel between your cloud-based machine and the remote host 
running LAMMPS. This will allow your Streamlit app to communicate with the 
LAMMPS instance.
```bash
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 username@remote-host-ip
```
Replace `username` with the actual username, `remote-host-ip` with the IP 
address of the remote host, and `8080` with a free port on your 
cloud-based machine.

**3. Configure Streamlit to use SSH tunnel**

In your Streamlit app, set up an environment variable `ST_Tunnel` to 
specify the SSH tunnel configuration:
```python
import os

os.environ['ST_Tunnel'] = 'username@remote-host-ip:8080'
```
Replace `username` and `remote-host-ip` with the actual values.

**4. Run LAMMPS remotely**

In your Streamlit app, use a library like `subprocess` to run the LAMMPS 
simulation on the remote host:
```python
import subprocess

# Specify the LAMMPS executable and input file
lammps_executable = '/path/to/lammps/executable'
input_file = 'example.input'

# Run LAMMPS remotely using SSH tunnel
ssh_tunnel = os.environ['ST_Tunnel']
remote_command = f'ssh {ssh_tunnel} mpirun -np 4 
/path/to/lammps/executable < input_file'

subprocess.run(remote_command, shell=True)
```
Replace `/path/to/lammps/executable` with the actual path to the LAMMPS 
executable on the remote host.

**5. Display results in Streamlit app**

Once the LAMMPS simulation is complete, you can display the results in 
your Streamlit app using various libraries like `matplotlib` or `plotly`.

Here's a simple example of how you could structure your code:
```python
import streamlit as st
import subprocess

# Set up SSH tunnel environment variable
os.environ['ST_Tunnel'] = 'username@remote-host-ip:8080'

# Run LAMMPS remotely using SSH tunnel
lammps_executable = '/path/to/lammps/executable'
input_file = 'example.input'
ssh_tunnel = os.environ['ST_Tunnel']
remote_command = f'ssh {ssh_tunnel} mpirun -np 4 
/path/to/lammps/executable < input_file'

subprocess.run(remote_command, shell=True)

# Display results in Streamlit app
st.title('LAMMPS Simulation Results')
results_plot = st.pyplot(matplotlib.plot([1, 2, 3]))
```
